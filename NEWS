genoPlotR changes
=================

0.5.3 - 2010-09-08
------------------
Article published in Bioinformatics, added a CITATION file.

0.5.2 - 2010-08-24
------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- Added read_dna_seg_from_fasta, that can read a fasta file and return one
  segment of the corresponding length
- Added two arguments to plot_gene_map, to allow to define the minimum gap
  length and to allow to have fixed gap length but still automating the 
  placement of the whole segment.
BUGFIX:
- Corrected a bug that provoked errors in displaying subsegments that were 
  closer to each other than the gap length

0.5.1 - 2010-08-19
------------------
BUGFIX:
- Added aliases in the documentation to avoid warnings when compiling

0.5   - 2010-06-14
------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- New argument to plot_gene_map: n_scale_ticks, gives the approx. number of 
  ticks in the dna_seg_scales
- New argument to plot_gene_map: scale_cex, allows to change the size
  of the labels in dna_seg_scales
- New argument to plot_gene_map: dna_seg_label_cex, allows to change the 
  size of the labels in the tree or dna_seg_labels


0.4.1 - 2010-06-01
------------------
BUGFIX:
- Added support for large phylogenetic trees. Given the mandatory use of
  enum.phylog to permute the trees to fit the labels with the dna_seg labels,
  big trees (requiring more than 1000 permutations) broke the program.
  Now either the tree is permutable, in the right order, or an error is
  thrown.

0.4   - 2010-04-19 
------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- Add the multisegment support
- dna_scales, annotations on all the segments, 
- Generated new examples. 

0.3   - 2010-04-09
------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- On plot_gene_maps, it is now possible to add automatic scale to any or 
  all dna_segments.
- It is possible (and recommended) to apply "global" color scheme at the 
  time of plotting (and not when parsing comparisons).
INTERNALS:
- Application of color schemes is now more rational
- Named every element and viewport, so its easier to navigate
- Removed dependancies to RColorBrewer

0.2   - 2010-01-11
------------------
Initial commit to R-Forge
